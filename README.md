# Klein
A declarative UI Library made for Roblox LUAU. Klein strives to be lightweight, asynchronous, and intuitive.
This project is currently in very early stages. **It is unstable, so do not use it in your projects yet.**

### Why Klein?
Currently, the most popular UI library out there is [Roact](https://roblox.github.io/roact/). However, Roact is not asynchronous - which is fine for smaller projects,
but may cause performance issues in projects which large component trees. Klein attempts to solve this.

Furthermore, Klein tries to make mutable state more intuitive. It is founded on the principle that programmers should expect state to be mutated from the get-go without special accessors.

### What to expect?
This project is in an early stage. It is nowhere near production-ready, and currently serves as a proof of concept.
Roact is a perfectly fine UI library for most use-cases. But Klein tries to achieve things in a different way, which may be useful to some people.
